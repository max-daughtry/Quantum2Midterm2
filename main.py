# Alright so this is basically just a dumb binary search
# over the energy levels

# You use sqrt(2m(V_g - V(x))) and integrate that where V_g is your guess and V(x) is the potential equation (left hand side of wkb)
# You set the right hand side h\pi(n+1/2) to whatever n value you want
# Compare the left side to the right side, depending on whether the lef side is bigger or smaller you adjust your upper
# and lower bounds for your energy guess until you converge on some energy and then that should be your energy

# Be prepared to see some interesting techniques but I didn't really know how else to go about it
